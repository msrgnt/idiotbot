# idiotbot
A slackbot that hates Obama/loves Trump, doesn't trust the MSM, and is an idiot.

Get its attention with a mere "hey".

Get playful: ask "Where is Silverbot?" and "How are you Silverbot?". Silverbot's responses will not brighten your day.

Silverbot will chime in if you talk about Obama or Trump, and will (idiotically) respond to questions about both pols, unemployment, and the state of economy. Be sure to ask Silverbot what exactly it means ("What do you mean?"), for its unthoughtful clarifications.

If you ask, Silverbot will also tell you that its favorite band is Nickelback. It'll share its preferred food and programming language too. 

MAGA!!! 

Now leave Silverbot alone so it can go watch more HANNITY.
